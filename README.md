### About
*myRemote* is an Android application to act as a remote control for your PC (works best on Windows). It is simple to start using, and very easy to learn the controls (very similar to a TV remote). The app allows the user to connect to their PC device over Wi-Fi, enabling control over the PC’s mouse, keyboard input, quick access to popular media sites such as YouTube & Netflix, and more. The application is split into 2 parts; client and server.

#### To install:
- Click [Releases](https://github.com/kell90/myRemote/releases) in this repository and download myRemote_Client.apk, and myRemote_Server.jar.
- Install and run the APK on an Android device or emulator (tested and optimized for the Nexus5X, API > 20).
- Run the myRemote_Server.jar file on a PC.
- Upon running the server-side application, the interface will display an IP address, as well as a port number. 
- Enter the IP address and port number into the mobile app’s login page and tap "Connect"
